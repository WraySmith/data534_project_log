**General:**  
Meeting with Ryan and Mitch to discuss getting the code up to speed with unit testing. The plan was for each of us to complete unit tests for one of the .R files as follows:

- utils.R: Nate
- recall_count.R: Ryan
- recall_data.R: Mitch


**Nate Completed:**  
Created, PR and merged in branch `unittest-utils2` to main. 95% coverage acheived on utils.R

Reviewed and commented on the PR for the `test-for-recall-data` branch: https://github.com/WraySmith/caRecall/pull/28. Comments mainly around potentially reducing the number of API calls in the test as well as creating some user defined test functions as many of the tests are quite repetitive between the different functions in `recall_data.R`.
