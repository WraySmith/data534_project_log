**Nate Completed:**  
Started work on additional functionality that was added to Issue #6: https://github.com/WraySmith/caRecall/issues/6 including:

- allow a user to pass in a year range to `recall_by_make()` or `recall_by_model()`
- allow a user to pass in a list of make/model and have `recall_by_make()` or `recall_by_model()` output data related to the list of inputs
- modify `recall_details()` to handle an input list of numbers that queries the API multiple times and returns a dataframe of the output
