**General:**  
Ryan and Mitch completed their PRs for the unit tests on `recall_count.R` and `recall_data.R`


**Nate Completed:**  
General discussion on the PRs. 

Due to API calls performed during unittests and multiple CICD actions performing 10 rounds of testing (4x different operating systems and a coverage run which all occur during both push and pull), the API calls was hitting the allowable limit. Started looking into solutions for reducing the number of CICD actions performed.
