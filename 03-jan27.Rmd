**Items Completed:**

- Read background documents.
- Created a branch and Setup R package using the `devtools` package following the guide in the R Packages book. The package currently just contains placeholders using the R file `rangeyear.R`. The tests and man directories were also setup and corresponding test and document placeholder files for `rangeyear.R` were created.
